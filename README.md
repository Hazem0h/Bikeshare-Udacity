# Bikeshare-Udacity
This is my implementation for the Bikeshare project on Udaity.  <br>
Basically, you have the bike-riding data for 3 US states in 3 csv files. The data in the csv files includes:
- Data about the Trip itself
1. Start time
2. End Time 
3. Trip duration in minutes
4. Start and end destination
- Data about the user
1. User Type
2. Gender
3. Birth year

From this data, you have a console application that prints "trip" and "bike user" statistics to the console. The console prompts the user to filter results by state, and datam and lets the user view the raw data in the console
